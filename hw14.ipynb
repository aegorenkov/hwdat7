We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive.\",\n       \"Maybe I should have had a hot dog but I crave Chicago's Italian beef,  I didn't get it here just some greasy old beef of some kind,  use beef broth if the meat gets dry, not a whole can of olive oil,  YUK!  It didn't have that good Italian beef flavor so I asked for giardinara to add some flavor,  it was very oily too and I had to pay extra for any peppers either hot or mild. No stars for that beef,  the only saving grace was it didn't make me too sick,  I expected to be sick for days not just one day!\",\n       'Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou\\'ve been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman\\'s on a worthless Jhane Barnes\\' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season\\'s-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you\\'re toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s OK, but beware. Unagi and other \"hot\" items have a \"beep-beep beep-beep\" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- \\'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol\\' times\\' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd about the Brioni... Don\\'t sweat the buyer\\'s remorse. It\\'ll make a great tax deduction to Florence\\'s.',\n       \"THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!  It really deserves NO STARS!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can only like this place if you don't know anything about Vietnamese food. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I tried...\\r\\n\\r\\nBun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?  You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?\\r\\n\\r\\nService stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can't cook something why even bother serving it to customers.  I don't know about other entrees they offer but I won't be coming back to find out.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley. \\r\\n\\r\\nCheck out my extensive list of Vietnamese Restaurants for suggestions to better ones.\",\n       '\"The office space, layout, presentation gets 5 stars, the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10. They will scare your clients off, scare your own staff and make your life a living hell. Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say, a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time, they will be told to leave. They will be told you don\\'t provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image, Corporate Office Centers can do this for you! BE AFRAID!!!! They are dedicated to working against, not with you.\"',\n       'I wrote a less than stellar review about this place some time ago and decided that my prior awful experience might have been a fluke and as I love great BBQ, decided to give them another go .....  I was right the first time!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs before, the food was ho-hum at best, the prices too high vs the product quality but the death blow to me was once again, their customer service or shall I say lack of customer service?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had to ask the bartender if we could get a drink (That\\'s odd) and all the wait staff acted like they were doing us a favor by waiting on us.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo top it all off, they had little to no air conditioning so it was brutal to sit through a combination of bad food, crummy service and high heat!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor me, this place is officially off the books and we sure won\\'t be back. Lesson # 1: \"Your in the service industry, try and acy like it\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a BBQ fan, I\\'ll try elsewhere ...............',\n       \"You want good food? You'd be better off smuggling goat cheese in your boot and risking an anal cavity search for doing so than eating at this airport.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou want scenery?

Well you are in the desert so you'd probably better off finding a cactus and straddling it face first.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou want a relatively close connection for your flight? Well tough shit.  Oh yeah, they've got people movers but somehow they have this magical ability to disengage people's legs.  Yeah I know it sounds crazy but as soon as people step on to these things their legs stop moving and they plant their fat ass right in the middle of the walk way.  Whats wrong with your legs you mammoth!?\",\n       \"Remember how I said that the Trivia was the best thing about this place?

My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones.  Then, the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible.  We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry.  The Calamari was extremely oily.

My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries.

Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. \\r\\n\\r\\nI know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I paid for this was ridiculous.\\r\\nThe way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.\\r\\nThe food was meh.\\r\\nNot even I was tempted to try breakfast there.\\r\\nIt was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience.

It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.

I added bacon for a dollar.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if:\\r\\n1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch??\\r\\n2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full.\\r\\n3.  They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better?\\r\\nAnyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.\\r\\n\\r\\nI finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon.\\r\\nWTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out, but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.\\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!\\r\\n\\r\\nExactly one hour and 20 minutes later, I had vicious diarrhea\\r\\n\\r\\nI haven't had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair!\\r\\n\\r\\nNo.  NO.

While the burgers are cooked in a coal oven, you could tell by the smoke hanging over the restaurant, they are cooked in an iron skillet i.e. pan fried!

If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area, go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St.(http://www.sonoraveterinaryspecialists.com/). It\\'s also 24/7, but unlike VCA PVEAH, it is a truly valuable, legitimate facility, and it\\'\\'s staffed by engaged, committed, deeply caring, and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel. At SVS, you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified.\\r\\n\\r\\nVCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way. VCA is, in fact, the WORST of corporate animal service providers. The space is small, cheap, cramped, and the staff are indifferent at best and don\\'t convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress. All they want is your money. They do NOTHING for the $99.75 they charge for an \"emergency exam.\" We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate, literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody, traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication).  Furthermore, they tack on bogus surcharges ($5.25 for a \"biohazard waste fee\") that are irrelevant to the \"service\" provided, and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet, anyone?\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, our (and our dog\\'s) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency), and the cost was ultimately significantly less.\\r\\n\\r\\nVCA is a money-grubbing, depressing, sham.',\n       \"I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.

It wasn\\'t too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs we were looking at the \"lunch special\" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom \"are you Chinese?\" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in \"what does that mean?\" The lady proceeded by pointing at the \"seafood pancake\" section on the menu and saying \"I don\\'t know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot.\" Good thing my mom didn\\'t hear what she said.. or else... \\r\\n\\r\\nSo we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini \"kimchi\" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn\\'t take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said \"you can\\'t take that home\". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said \"you are not allowed to take the kimchi home\". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? \"Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?\" She hesitantly gave me a lid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hey, hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say \\'no stealing kimchi\\'\"... only if I said that to her face...\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.  \\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service, please just go to Chodang.

I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn\\'t care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn\\'t good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn\\'t try it. \\r\\n\\r\\nLettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn\\'t work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don\\'t have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn\\'t care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client.
